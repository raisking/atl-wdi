# Class Wiki Treasure Hunt

In this assignment, you will read through the class wiki and answer the
questions given below.

## Questions

Please do not use any resource other than the class wiki
(or the materials it references)
to answer these questions.

1.  What are the three requirements for completing this course?
        1) Homework submission needs to be at 80% or higher
        2) Attendance must be consistent (please see the Attendance Policy)
        3)All unit projects need be submitted and presented to the instructional team and should meet project rubric expectations


2.  At what URL can you find a series of videos covering the terminal, created
    by one of GA's senior instructors?
    
    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdnONIhPScSToZztXRHyKZTQEsE30luMx

3.  What book by Douglas Crockford is on our recommended reading list?
    
    Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crockford

4.  According to our Git style guide, when writing the detailed description of
    a commit in its commit message, what three types of things are most
    important to mention?
    
        1) Don't split a single logical change into several commits. For example, the implementation of a    feature and the corresponding tests should be in the same commit.

        2) Commit early and often. Small, self-contained commits are easier to understand and revert when    something goes wrong.

        3) Commits should be ordered logically. For example, if commit X depends on changes done in       commit Y, then commit Y should come before commit X.

5.  What does a bug report need to have before it can be submitted to the bug
    journal?
        Copy the error message
        Copy the code in question
        Write a paragraph explaining:
                What you thought the error was
                What the issue turned out to be
                How you solved it

6.  There are three Git tutorials referenced in the Wiki. What are they?
        https://git-scm.com/documentation
        1) Reference https://git-scm.com/docs
        2) Book https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
        3) Videos https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control

7.  List at least two basic UI styling tips that will help your projects
    look good.
        1) Unordered lists and hrefs
        2) Add pointers to buttons and links!

8.  What is the maximum number of absences a student can have, and how many
    'tardies' are equal to an absence?
     
     1) 2 late arrivals = 1 absence. 15 minutes late results in a tardy. Late arrival is a result of not being logged on to Zoom, Cloud9, and Slack by 10:15 am EDT
     2) Missing part of the day of class counts as Â½ day absence
     3) Students can have no more than 2 absences

    winter break)?
