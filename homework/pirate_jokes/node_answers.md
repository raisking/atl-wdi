Describe what the package is, in a few words or sentences (you may have to refer to the original documentation listed under each links' description).
=> object-assign : Assigns enumerable own properties of source objects to the target object and returns the target object. Additional source objects will overwrite previous ones.

=> css-loader: interprets @import and url() like import/require() and will resolve them. 

=> aws-sdk: allow you to reduce the SDK's size, specify different API versions of services, or use AWS services that don't currently support CORS if you are working in an environment that does not enforce CORS.

=> extend: is a port of the classic extend() method from jQuery. It behaves as you expect. It is simple, tried and true.

=> handlebars: is an extension to the Mustache templating language. Handlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be.

=> chai: Chai is an assertion library, similar to Node's build in assert. It makes testing much easier by giving you lots of assertions you can run against your code.
